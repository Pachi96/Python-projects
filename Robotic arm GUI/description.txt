This program is intended to be used on a Raspberry Pi.
It allows the user to manipulate the position of the
servo motors of a robotic arm, wether by moving a scroll
bar or by inserting in a text box the angle (0 - 180ยบ)
to which the motor has to be positioned.

The GUI is implemented with the library guizero, and the
mechanism that makes the manipulation of the position of 
the motors possible is the PWM pins of a Raspberry Pi
